# Pokemon Showdown Utility Tool

## or PLutility for short

### Overview

This is a toy react app made with typescript styled with ant design to provide utility tools for running a hobby pokemon showdown league my friends are playing in.
The first goal is to create a tool that will make a "Trainer Card". This will essentially let select 6-10 pokemon and generate a nice jpeg image that display relevant data other trainers in the league can use for at a glance reference when planning there team for the week.
